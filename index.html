		<h1> Mobile Legends</h1>
		<p><strong>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang </strong> is a MOBA game designed for <em>mobile phones</em>. The two opposing teams fight to reach and destroy the enemy's base while defending their own base for control of a path, the three "lanes" known as "top", "middle" and "bottom", which connects the bases. In each team, there are five players who each control an avatar, known as a "hero", from their own device. Weaker computer-controlled characters, called "minions", spawn at team bases and follow the three lanes to the opposite team's base, fighting enemies and turrets.</p>

		<p>Mobile Legends is a game where you can choose between 6 ifferent classes. There is Tank, Fighter, Assassin, Mage, Marksman and Support class. I have been playing with the Mage class, with all 3 heroes. I find them a little bit hard to play, so I will make a guide on how to use Nana, Alice and Eudora skills. As you may already know, there are 3 different modes in Mobile Legends, Match Up, Ranked Game and Brawl Mode. Match Up mode is 5 vs 5 lane mode, where you and your team needs to destroy the “Enemy’s Crystal” to win. If you want to enter Ranked Game, you need to have 5 heroes owned. Brawl mode is the mode where you can choose between 2 heroes and fight against the enemy. Only in the Brawl mode you are able to test the heroes that you don’t own. In the other modes you need to purchase them in the game, with experience points or diamonds.</p>

		<h2> Character Skills</h2>
		<p>For a cat elf, Nana is a slow hero, but with high mana points and mana regen. Nana’s skills are Nimble, her passive skill, Boomerang, Morph Spell and Dragon Cat Summons. She uses her passive skill to increase her movement speed. The boomerang she throws deals 165 magic dmg, but only in a specific direction. With the Morph skill, she transforms an enemy into a Dragon Cat and slows their movement speed for 3 seconds.</p>

		<p>Dragon Cat Summons is her ult. Nana summons a Dragon Cat in a specific area, knocks the enemies airborne for a second and deals 400 magic dmg. My advice is to use her skills as following, Morph Skill first, then her Boomerang and her ult for last. In this order the enemy will be slowed and will receive a lot of damage from your allies. At the end, this is a team player hero. Going solo will only affect of breaking your phone or tablet ??Nana is with 3 skins in Mobile Legends, Feline Wizard, Wonderland and Graveyard Party. </p>

		<p>Slow hero with only 2.4 movements speed but with high HP regen and mana regen points. Blood is what keeps her moving, but she uses mana to cast spells. Blood Ancestry is her passive skill. Every time Alice kills a minion, she will use his blood to increase her magic power. Her second skill is Flowing Blood. Alice shoots a blood blob in a specific direction. If the blood blob hits an enemy, it will deal 260 magic dmg. Blood Awe is Alice’s next skill. Using this skill the enemy will receive 310 magic dmg and will be stunned for 1.5 seconds. </p>
		


		<h2> Difficulty </h2>

		<p>Some of them are special, but some of them might be boring for the old majority of players. World of Warcraft since Legion have offered multiple paths for players to choose whether is that going to be boosting their different specs or focusing on building a good Alt so they can contribute to better Raid. Anyhow, the difficulty was quite high at the beginning of the Legion expansion, and now when we’re getting close to the new expansion, it is becoming a lot easier. Plus, whenever the further development comes out the artifact weapons will probably be gone. But, even if Blizzard has hinted anything, it is still unknown until we witness the release. Now, back to the main subject. Let’s preview some of the good events that are going to become available starting tomorrow.</p>

		<p>After those finish, there will be Darkmoon Faire available to visit once again, so whoever got the needed amount of tickets can spend them to get something “COOL.” What is the most amazing event is that nine days in 2018, players will have the chance to grab extra loot by doing Legion dungeons, which means the bosses will drop an additional loot. Starting from 9th to 16th of January, Blizzard will allow players to prepare for what’s about to come slowly.</p>

		<p>Legion has brought both retired and new players to World of Warcraft throughout the Legion expansion. After highlighting the essential changes, we have been looking at patch 7.3.5 in which other zone levels will set up accordingly to your character’s level, which allows players to level up new toons in their favorite zone. This will create such an overwhelming and nostalgic moment for older players.</p>


			<h2> Gameplay Tips </h2> 


		<p>Most people would just go straight to lane the moment the minions spawn. What most don’t know is that you and your lane partner can kill 2 jungle creeps and arrive in lane for a level 2 advantage. That gives you the opportunity to get the first kill the moment you show up in lane. Ideally, you should run a marksman with a support or tank that can engage or have crowd control capabilities to get an early first kill. Someone like Franco paired with a marksman like Layla or a mage like Alice would really decimate lane opponents when Franco is able to land a hook! You will also need to bring the execute battle spell to execute your enemy that is running away from you.</p>

		<p>For many beginners, it can be overwhelming to keep learning new characters, especially if you still don’t know the basic mechanics of the game.
For example, as Layla gets to max level, she is able to fire at towers without getting into tower range. That means she is great for turret sieges WITH your team. As long as she is protected in the front, she can fire away and destroy towers quickly. Fanny can move around the map quickly with her chains and it requires a bit of practice to get used to her extreme mobility. I have seen good Fanny players getting away with dying in situations where most players would accept their fate. Franco’s hooks also takes a bit of practice to keep landing them. Sometimes, you have to gauge whether your enemy will try to juke your hooks or walk in a straight line. Most new players will walk in a straight line, but more experienced players will make use of side steeping on going to bushes to make your hooks harder to land.</p>
